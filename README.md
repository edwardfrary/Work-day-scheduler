# Work-day-scheduler
 
This scheduler is a series of time coded columns on which one or more tasks can be added by simply clicking the empty space. A modal will display and users can enter in the tasks as they see fit. Once the save button is clicked the task will be added to the appropriate space on the scheduler with a delete button beside it. Tasks will persist through reloads until the delete button is pressed, which will remove the task from both the scheduler and local storage. 

In addition the colour of the rows will change as time goes by in a day:

Red: Already passed
Yellow: Within the next 2 hours (rounded up to the nearest whole hour)
White: On schedule and more than 2 hours away.

Please see attached screenshot.
